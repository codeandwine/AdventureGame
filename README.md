## 1. Using time.sleep method

"time" was imported to be able to calculate the time for which the game is run.

```Python
import time
start = time.time()
.
.
.
end = time.time()
```
It is also used to control the pauses between the printing of each message by calling on the sleep method.

```Python
def print_pause(message, seconds):
    print(message)
    time.sleep(seconds)
```
